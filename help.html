            The Credit Point (CP) of each course is calculated by:<br>
        
            CP = Credit Unit (CU) * Rating<br>
            The Total Number of Units (TNU) is gotten by summing the CU of all the courses used in the calculation.<br>
            The Total Credit Point (TCP) is gotten by summing the CP of all the courses used in the calculation.<br>
            The Grade Point Average (GPA) then calculated:<br>
            GPA = TCP / TNU

        <p>
            For Cumulative GPA (CGPA) calculation:<br>
            The summation of every TNU is gotten from every semester from beginning to date as Cumulative Number of Units (CNU).
            While the summation of every TCP is gotten as Cumulative Credit Point (CCP).<br>
            
            Then the CGPA is calculated:<br>
            CGPA = CCP / CNU
